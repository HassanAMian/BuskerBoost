This application is a Twitter-like app that allows you to follow and tip street performers, who can post status messages with information on where they're going to be.  The Stripe API also allows you to pay a tip (currently in $1 increments) on the artisits profile page. 

This hobby project is a work in progress, and I intend to add some other features in the future, including:
- soundcloud API
- ability to embed youtube videos using a URL
- phone application version for iOS
- crowdfunding ability with links on the user profile page

- gem 'rails', '4.0.8'
